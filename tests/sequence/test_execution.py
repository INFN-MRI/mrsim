"""Choosing where a simulation runs.

``execution`` collapses three separate decisions into one: host or device, how
many devices, and whether the volume can be resident or has to be streamed. The
tests split accordingly -- what gets chosen, and whether every route that could
be chosen produces the same numbers.

Deciding reads the free memory on the card, so the size tests pin the reserve
rather than trusting whatever else happens to be resident when they run.
