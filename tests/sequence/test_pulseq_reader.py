"""Reading a Pulseq file, against pypulseq's own reading and a closed form.

The sequences here are built with pypulseq and written to disk, so what the
reader is asked for -- the flip angle, the echo time, which sample sits at
k = 0 -- is checked twice over: against pypulseq's own trajectory, and against
the spoiled gradient-echo steady state, which has never seen a sequence file.
