    Returns 1 when every pulse in the sequence turns the same way about one
    axis -- all the RF phases equal -- and there is neither off-resonance,
    transmit phase, nor spin velocity. The states then start real, and every operator the kernels carry
    keeps them real: the rotation about a single axis has real coefficients on
    the axis the signal lies on, the shift's conjugate coupling becomes a sign,
    relaxation and spoiling scale, and an ideal inversion scales the
    longitudinal states alone.

    A refocused train whose excitation shares the phase of its refocusing
    pulses is the CPMG arrangement; a spoiled or unbalanced train whose pulses
    all share one phase is the same condition with no refocusing pulse in it,
    which is what a fingerprinting schedule is.

    Pulses a half turn apart are refused although their states do stay real.
    They turn about one axis in opposite senses, and what the reduced kernels
    carry is a flip angle with no sign to say which sense -- so an excitation a
    half turn from its refocusing pulses, or a train alternating its phase,
    goes to the full kernels.

    Flow dephasing turns each dephasing order through a phase of its own, which
    is a rotation out of the axis rather than a scaling along it. Washout stays
    on the axis -- it scales both relaxation factors and nothing more -- but the
    real kernels do not carry it, so any velocity at all is refused here
    whatever geometry drives it.

    A transmit array is not on that list: a row per shim scales the flip its
    own pulse turns through, which is a scaling along the axis. Its phase is,
    and a shimmed array is held to the same zero as a single map.

    Two arrangements make the recorded echoes look real without confining the
    states, and both are refused. Off-resonance is refocused at the echo
    centers but not between them. An excitation a quarter turn from the
    refocusing pulses gives a signal that is real at every sample while its
    states fill the plane -- a real projection of a complex trajectory, not a
    subspace a kernel can be built on, and the phase spread is what rules it
    out.

    ``features`` names the terms the caller's tissue gives anything to do, as
    :func:`torchsim.sequence._parameters.features_of` reads them off the values
