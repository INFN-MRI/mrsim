"""What the spins are, and what each kind of event does to them.

A signal model made of a state machine splits in two. A
:class:`SpinPhysics` says what a voxel holds -- which tissue properties
are exposed, and so which physics the kernels carry -- and what each kind of
event is realized as: whether an excitation is ideal or integrated from a
waveform, whether a readout is followed by an unbalanced gradient, by ideal
spoiling, or by nothing. A :class:`Simulator` says what order the
events are played in.

Splitting them is what lets one be changed without the other. The MRF timing
with a selective excitation, or a refocused train whose readout spoils rather
than winds, is an assignment rather than a new model.

**The operators are resolved before a description exists.** A simulator binds
each slot when it is constructed; what a protocol then produces is an ordinary
:class:`~torchsim.sequence.SequenceDescription`, whose events carry their own
action word. From there the path is the fused one -- packing, the feature
mask, the real-subspace verdict, offload and sharding -- and nothing consults
an operator slot again. There is no interpretation at run time and none per
event.

Three vocabularies name a pulse along that path, and they are not the same
vocabulary at three sizes. :class:`EventOperators` has one slot per role a
sequence is written in terms of, and its values are operator factories, read
only while a description is being assembled. Each factory emits events tagged
with an :class:`~torchsim.sequence.RfUse`, which is what a Pulseq file
carries, and with an :class:`~torchsim.sequence.EventAction`, which is the bit
field the kernels read. The three do not line up one to one and are not meant
to: the :attr:`~EventOperators.saturation` slot plays a pulse tagged
``RfUse.EXCITATION``, because what the scanner is told about a pulse and what
role the sequence gives it are separate questions.

            Where to run -- ``"auto"`` to decide per call against what the

            ``None`` follows whatever :func:`~torchsim.sequence.execution`
            block is in scope, which is what lets a caller decide instead.
        pulse:
            The waveform the events drive, taking the place of the ideal hard
            rotation the shipped operators name. Giving one is what makes the

            The transmit shims the pulses are driven on, by id, for a layout
            whose operators name a ``shim_id``. One channel driven alike when

        across_slice:
            How many positions across the slice to integrate a shaped pulse
            at, or an ``exact_slice_profile()`` saying which. ``None`` works
            it out at the slice centre alone, which is the hard-pulse answer.

            Whether to hold the protocol's structure fixed across calls, so
            that a call which changes only numbers rebinds them onto events
            already packed. A loop that plays the same sequence with

            roughly eight times the whole call this way. Turning it off

            The unbalanced gradient the sequence plays, and the voxel it winds

            turns each dephasing order through.

        This is the path a description arriving from a scanner takes:

        read as a refocused train, and the only thing left to give is the
        tissue. Echo spacing, echo train length, flip angles and pulse shapes
        are in the stream and are not named again.

        Which simulator you call it on is the whole of what you choose, and it
        matters. A description says what was played -- an RF pulse, tagged with
        the use its designer gave it, and an ADC window -- and says nothing
        about the gradients between them, because the transport carries none.
        The dephasing lives in the handlers instead: a
        :func:`~torchsim.SSFPFidReadout` winds one order after every sample, a
        :func:`~torchsim.SSFPEchoReadout` winds it before, a

        description : SequenceDescription
            The stream, as the MRD client decodes it or a Pulseq design
